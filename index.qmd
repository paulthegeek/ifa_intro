## What is Ifá?

The traditions, practices, and spritual system of the Yoruba people of West Africa. It's a system of divination, ethics, cosmology, and a way of life. It is one the oldest spritual traditions in the world, predating many of the most popular religions and spritiual systems of the world. The Yoruba religion is the root of many of the African Traditional Religions (ATR) such as Santería, Candomblé, and Vodun. The divniation system is based on the Holy Odu which consists of 256 Odu (chapters). They are broken down into 16 major Odu and 246 minor Odu, with each containing many ẹsẹ (verses). The holy Odu states that we are all have a chosen destiny that we must fulfill to accomplish the goal of bringing heaven(orun) to Earth(aye).
